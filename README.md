# Todo List with Plain JavaScript and LocalStorage

This project is a simple Todo List application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It uses `localStorage` to save tasks so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the app, including responsive design.
- `script.js`: Handles the functionality of the Todo List, including task addition, deletion, completion, and data persistence with `localStorage`.
